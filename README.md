## My Process

I started this project by writing the main codes in HTML and styling it in CSS. Also, I made use of CSS bootstrap in some aspects and added fontawesome CDN in the stylesheet so we can be able to use some icons. Furthermore, I added some JavaScript functionalities as part of the back-end specifically in the sign up and login forms. 

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I Learned 

This project taught me valuable lessons in front-end development, user experience design, JavaScript interactivity, and considerations for backend functionality and security. I learned about version control, communication, and project management. I also gained insights into testing, debugging, continuous learning, and basic eCommerce concepts, ultimately enhancing my technical skills and understanding of online business dynamics.
